    <h1 id="manisha">Java Script to change the innerText of that heading. </h1>

    <!-- <h2>The setTimeout() Method</h2> -->
    <h2 id="hacked"></h2>
      <p>Wait 3 seconds for the page had been hacked:</p>


    <!-- <script src="main.js"></script> -->
    

    <p>Group 1: Create an HTML page with an h1 heading and use javascript to change the innerText of that heading. 
        Change it to indicate that the page had been hacked.
    </p>

    <!-- <P>Group 2: Use setTimeout with an arrow function to update the absolute position of an image in an HTML page. 
        The goal is to have the image dance around on the page randomly.</P>

        Group 3: Use classes in Javascript to create a reusable button. The constructor has a message and an emoji for the button. To attach the button to the DOM you use a method ""render" than takes a DOM element (a container element) and attaches the button there.
         To demonstrate the class you can create an array of buttons using 10 different texts and emojis -->
